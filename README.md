# Spot Scout (Under Development)

Spot Scout is a location analysis and prediction platform designed to help users determine the most suitable type of establishment for a given location based on its latitude and longitude. The platform also offers map analysis tools, allowing users to visualize, save, and edit maps for reference. Secure login and session management ensure a seamless and safe experience for all users.

## Features

- **Location Prediction**: Spot Scout leverages a trained machine learning model to predict what type of establishment is best suited for a specific location based on its latitude and longitude.
  
- **Map Analysis**: Users can analyze maps with various tools and functions, including the ability to save and load maps for future reference or modification.

- **Secure Authentication**: Spot Scout ensures a safe and secure login experience by utilizing tokens, refresh tokens, and cookies to manage user sessions.

- **Data-Driven Model**: Our prediction model is powered by open-source data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), which provides a rich source of geospatial information used to train the model.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 18
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication, with session management using cookies and refresh tokens.
- **Data Source**: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
